        <div class = "dialogue-box-2-text">Vision Forge is a startup founded by Lander Azarcon, a 4th year Computer Engineering student at FEU TECH 
          who got the idea for the dotted ruler once when trying to design a circuit board for one of his computer engineering classes. He pierced 
          holes using plastic, and from there it evolved to the dotted ruler that you see now â€“ with the same function of designing a circuit board, 
          but now enhanced with more functions.<br><br>Vision Forge are currently incubatees for the ongoing TamLabs startup incubation program at the 
          FEU TECH Innovation Center, with the end goal of becoming a homegrown successful start-up company.</div>
